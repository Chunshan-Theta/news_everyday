---

Jumping on tram #1 in front of the Staatsoper (state opera house). 
Circling the Ringstrasse (grand boulevard vienna ring road) 
for a great tour with a public transport ticket.
Passing the Hofburg (imperial palace), Parlament, 
Burggarten (imperial court's garden), 
Rathaus (city council), Burgtheater (imperial court's theatre),
Vienna University, and more.

Getting off at the Vienna University stop. 
Wandering to the heart of the city to the glourious
gothic Stepansdom (Stephan's cathedral).

Making my way to the Hofburg passing the Pestsäule (plague column) in the Graben
and the Michaeler Tor (St. Michael's gate). Passing the National Library and
the Imperial Sisi Apartments and Crown Jewels.

Crossing the Ringstrasse to the Kunsthistorisches Museum (national art gallery) - home
to a breath-taking art collection. Must see! 
The (Great) Babel Tower by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (c.1525-1530 - 1569)
and the Geographer by Johannes Vermeer (1668 – 1669).

Recharging at 7 Stern Bräu in Neubau with a Gulash[^1] and beers brewed-on-location
with Vienna's fine tap water (from the Austrian Mountains).
Trying 7 Stern Märzen (5.1%, 13.5°),
7 Stern Weizen Classic (5.2%, 12.7°),
7 Stern Prager Dunkles (4.5%, 12.1°) and
today's special 7 Stern Smoked Porter (5.3%, 13.8°). Cheers. Prost.
