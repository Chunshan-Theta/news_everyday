Visiting the imperial palace Schönbrunn - the former summer residence
of the Habsburg family.
Taking an inside tour of the 1 441-room baroque palace.
Enjoying the Neptune Fountain and sculptures in the public garden.

Heading back to the city to explore Schloss Belvedere - another
unequalled baroque palace. Entering the art collection. 
Must see! The Kiss by Gustav Klimt (1862-1918) - 
a symbol of Vienna Jugendstil (Viennese Art Nouveau).

Recharging at Salm Bräu (Rennweg 8)
with Schinkenfleckerl (Austrian noodles with ham)
and beers brewed-on-location.
Trying Salm 1842 Pils (5.0%, 12.5°),
Salm Wiener Märzen (5.0%, 12.5°),
Salm Böhmisch Dunkles (5.0%, 12.5°)
and today's special Salm Burning Hell (4.9%, 12.2°). Cheers. Prost.
